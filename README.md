🚨 HelpZone — Real-Time Emergency Request Web App

**HelpZone** is a simple, responsive web application that allows users to request emergency help by filling out a form. The data is stored and displayed live using **Firebase Realtime Database**.  
Built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

- **JavaScript**
- **Firebase Realtime Database**



🔧 How It Works

- **User Side** (`index.html`):  
  Users fill out a form detailing their location, gender, type of emergency, and optionally their phone number. If "Other" is selected, they are prompted for more details.

- **Helper Side** (`helper.html`):  
  A live dashboard that listens for new help requests and displays them with statuses, timestamps, and visual cards.

- **Firebase**:  
  All form submissions are stored in **Firebase Realtime Database** and dynamically rendered on the helper page.



 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add authentication for helpers
- Status update controls (Resolved / Pending)
- Email or SMS notifications
- Deploy with a custom domain
